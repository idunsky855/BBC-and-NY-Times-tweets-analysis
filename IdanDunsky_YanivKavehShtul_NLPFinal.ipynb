        "## Frequency Extraction using Word2Vec\n",
        "\n",
        "Word2Vec is a type of neural network model used to learn vector representations of words from large text corpora. It operates in two main architectures: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram. CBOW predicts a target word from its surrounding context words, while Skip-gram predicts context words from a given target word. These vector representations capture semantic meanings and relationships between words, making Word2Vec useful for tasks such as word similarity, sentiment analysis, and language translation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using Word2Vec to find the most frequent words in a corpus is not its primary function, as Word2Vec is designed to create word embeddings based on the context in which words appear rather than to count word frequencies. However, you can still retrieve the most frequent words from the vocabulary built during the training of a Word2Vec model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",
        "- Training the Model: The Word2Vec model is trained on the corpus to create word embeddings.\n",
        "- Vocabulary and Counts: The key_to_index attribute of the model's wv (word vectors) object provides access to the vocabulary. The get_vecattr method retrieves the count of each word.\n",
        "- Sorting and Displaying: The words are sorted by their counts in descending order, and the top N most frequent words are displayed.\n",
        "This method leverages the internal vocabulary built during the Word2Vec training process to find the most frequent words in the corpus"

        "## Analysis of New York Times' Social Media Activity\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Observations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Daily Activity Patterns\n",
        "- Clear cyclical pattern in social media activity\n",
        "- Lowest activity: Early morning hours (07:00-08:00)\n",
        "- Activity increases significantly from 09:00, remains high throughout the day\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Peak Times\n",
        "- Tweets and Likes: Dramatic spike at 18:00 (6 PM), reaching over 500/hour\n",
        "- Posts: Generally consistent throughout the day, slight increase in afternoon/evening\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Engagement Metrics\n",
        "- Likes consistently outnumber tweets and posts most hours\n",
        "- Exceptionally high engagement at 18:00 for both tweets and likes\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Content Strategy\n",
        "- Relatively consistent posting frequency throughout the day\n",
        "- Slight increase in posts during afternoon and evening hours\n",
        "- Major spike in tweet activity at 18:00, possibly scheduled news roundup\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Audience Behavior\n",
        "- Highest engagement at 18:00, suggesting peak audience activity after work hours\n",
        "- Secondary engagement peak at 01:00, possibly late-night audience\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Platform Usage\n",
        "- Similar patterns for tweets and likes, indicating strong Twitter presence\n",
        "- Posts (possibly on other platforms) remain more consistent\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Time Zone Considerations\n",
        "- Data likely reflects Eastern Time (ET), given it's for the New York Times\n",
        "- Patterns align with U.S. East Coast workday and leisure hours\n",
        "\n",
        "### Potential Strategy Implications\n",
        "- Capitalize on 18:00 spike for major news releases or roundups\n",
        "- Consider audience segments active during late night hours\n",
        "- Maintain consistent content stream throughout the day\n",
        "- Explore reasons for high engagement at 18:00 to replicate success\n",
        "- Adjust staffing to ensure coverage during peak activity times"

        "### Key Observations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. General Trends\n",
        "- The BBC's social media activity varies significantly across different days of the week.\n",
        "- There's no consistent pattern across all three metrics (Tweets, Likes, Posts) for any given day.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Tweets\n",
        "- Tweets show the least variation across the week compared to Likes and Posts.\n",
        "- Saturday has the highest average number of tweets (around 75).\n",
        "- Thursday has the lowest average number of tweets (about 25).\n",
        "- Weekdays generally show lower tweet activity compared to weekends.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Likes\n",
        "- Likes demonstrate the highest variability among the three metrics.\n",
        "- Thursday stands out with the highest average number of likes (about 250).\n",
        "- Tuesday has the lowest average number of likes (less than 100).\n",
        "- No clear pattern between weekdays and weekends for likes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Posts\n",
        "- Posts show moderate variability throughout the week.\n",
        "- Sunday has the highest average number of posts (nearly 200).\n",
        "- Thursday has the lowest average number of posts (around 60).\n",
        "- Weekends (especially Sunday) seem to have higher posting activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Day-specific Insights\n",
        "- Sunday: Highest posting activity, moderate likes, average tweets.\n",
        "- Monday: Second-highest likes, above-average posts, below-average tweets.\n",
        "- Thursday: Highest likes, lowest posts, lowest tweets - an interesting anomaly.\n",
        "- Saturday: Highest tweets, above-average likes and posts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Potential Insights and Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Why does Thursday have such high likes despite low tweet and post numbers? Is there a specific content strategy for Thursdays?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The BBC seems to be most active in posting on Sundays. Is this related to weekly news cycles or audience engagement patterns?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The disconnect between posting frequency and likes suggests that content quality or type may be more important than quantity in driving engagement.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The relatively consistent tweet numbers across the week might indicate an automated or scheduled tweeting strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. The variation in activity across different metrics and days suggests the BBC might be tailoring its strategy for each platform and day of the week.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations and Further Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "- This data represents averages, so it doesn't capture potential variations due to specific events or seasons.\n",
        "- Information about the types of content posted on different days would provide more context.\n",
        "- Engagement rates (likes per post, for example) would offer additional insights into effectiveness.\n",

        "### Potential Insights and Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Why is Thursday such a high-activity day across all metrics? Is this related to content strategy or audience behavior?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The contrast between Saturday's high likes and low posts suggests highly engaging content. What type of content is posted on Saturdays?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The consistent low tweet activity from Sunday to Wednesday, despite varying posts, might indicate a focus on other platforms during these days.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Friday shows an unexpected dip in activity. Is this intentional or a result of audience engagement patterns?\n",
        "\n",
        "5. The general increase in activity towards the end of the week could be aligned with building anticipation for weekend content or news cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations and Further Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "- This data represents averages, so it doesn't capture variations due to specific events, breaking news, or seasonal trends.\n",
        "- Information about the types of content posted on different days would provide more context for the engagement patterns.\n",
        "- Engagement rates (likes per post or per tweet) would offer insights into content effectiveness across days.\n",
        "- Data on other metrics like shares, comments, or click-throughs would provide a more comprehensive view of engagement.\n",
        "- Comparison with competitor data (e.g., other major news outlets) could offer industry benchmarks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Comparison to BBC (Previous Analysis)\n",
        "- The New York Times shows more pronounced day-of-week patterns than the BBC.\n",
        "- Thursday is a high-activity day for both, but the NYT shows a more dramatic peak.\n",
        "- The NYT has higher overall numbers for likes compared to the BBC.\n",
        "- The NYT's weekend strategy seems different, with high likes but low posts on Saturday, contrasting with the BBC's high Sunday activity."
